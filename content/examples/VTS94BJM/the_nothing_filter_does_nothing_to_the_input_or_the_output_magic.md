title: the nothing filter does nothing to the input or the output - magic!
description: >-
  This example demonstrates how to generate a video thumbnail grid using
  FFmpeg’s powerful 'tile' filter. 


  By applying the 'tile' filter to a video file, you can combine multiple frames
  into a single image laid out in a grid format. 


  This is particularly useful for creating visual summaries or previews of video
  content. 


  The command provided uses the sharks.mp4 file, capturing 12 frames and
  arranging them in a 4x3 grid (4 columns and 3 rows).



  **Command Breakdown:**



  - `ffmpeg -i sharks.mp4` — Loads the input video file, sharks.mp4.

  - `-vf "select='not(mod(n,30))',tile=4x3"` — Applies two video filters in
  sequence:    

  - `select='not(mod(n,30))'` picks one frame every 30 frames (roughly one frame
  per second if the video is 30fps), preventing the grid from being filled with
  very similar consecutive frames.

  - `tile=4x3` composites the selected frames into a 4x3 grid, for a total of 12
  thumbnails.

  - `-frames:v 1 thumbnail_grid.png` — Tells FFmpeg to output a single image
  file, named thumbnail_grid.png, containing the generated grid.
