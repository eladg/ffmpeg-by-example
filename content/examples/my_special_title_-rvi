  FFplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries
  and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a testbed for the various FFmpeg
  APIs.


  In this example, we use the `-vf` flag to feed in the
  [`showinfo`](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#showinfo) filter to print
  a line containing various information for each input video frame.


  We use the
  [`2>&1`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/818255/in-the-shell-what-does-21-mean)
  is used to pipe stderr to stdout and finally the `grep "iskey:1"` command will
  only print lines where the string `iskey:1` is present.


  The grep part of the command is completely optional, without it `showinfo`
  will print all frames checksum, timestamp, size, sar and other useful
  infomation.
